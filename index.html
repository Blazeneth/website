<h2>About me</h2>

<p> 
   Having graduated from Reed College with a BA in math in the Spring of 2023 I am applying to PhD programs in math with an expected matriculation date of Fall 2024.
   I am broadly interested in algebra, number theory, and computational mathematics. Here is my <a href="CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>.
</p>

<p>
    I am spending the 2023/2024 academic year taking graduate classes as a visiting student at the University of Pennsylvania. My course schedule for
    the year is listed below:
</p>

<p>
    Fall 2023: Algebra I, Analysis I (complex analysis and measure theory), Differential Geometry, Partial Differential Equations
</p>

<p>
    Spring 2024: Algebra II, Analysis II (measure theory and functional analysis), Algebraic Topology, Algebraic Geometry
</p>

<p> 
    While at Penn I have compiled homework solutions for my Fall classes. I am not making these documents public, as to avoid any issues surrounding academic integrity, but they are
    available upon request.
</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<h4> Thesis </h4>
<p> 
    I wrote a year-long senior thesis on elliptic curves, modular forms, and Galois representations. The end-result was an expository paper which put together 
    the necessary background to state the Galois-theoretic version of the modularity theorem. My hope is that this is an accessible entry-point for those
    wishing to learn the subject. The document can be found <a href="ThesisFinal.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<h4> Solution Manuals </h4>
<p>
    Over a past summer I read Apostol's Modular Functions and Dirichlet Series in Number Theory. While studying the book I solved a good chunk of the exercises. I have compiled
    these solutions in a latex document and I am posting them <a href="ApostolSolutions.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<p> 
    While doing some algebraic number theory I decided I had to learn more commutative algebra, and so I started solving exercises from Atiyah and Macdonald's book. This document is a work in progress,
    I have only solved around 50% of the book's exercises, and I have only digitized around 50% of my solutions. I plan to continue until both of those numbers approach 100. The document can be found
    <a href="AtiyahMacdonaldSolutions.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<h4> Reed Course Projects</h4>
<p>
    While at Reed I wrote a few course projects. One on constructible numbers in Galois Theory, written with Adam Cohen and Tyler Dunaisky, can be found <a href="ConstructibleNumbers.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Another was on solid angle polynomials 
    with Sarah Kumar and can be found <a href="SolidAngles.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>
    Teaching
</h2>

<p>
    While at Reed I worked as a drop-in tutor for calculus, introduction to analysis, discrete structures, linear algebra, vector calculus, real analysis, and abstract algebra. I also graded 
    papers for introduction to analysis, abstract algebra, and number theory.
</p>

<p>
    I spent two summers working as a counselor at the <a href="https://rossprogram.org/" target="_blank">Ross Mathematics Program</a>

<p><table><tr><td><img src="http://math.jhu.edu/~savitt/GTM/warner.jpg" width=90 height=140 alt=""></td><td><p>If I were a Springer-Verlag Graduate Text in Mathematics, I would be Frank Warner's <b><i>Foundations of Differentiable Manifolds and Lie Groups</i></b>.</p><p> I give a clear, detailed, and careful development of the basic facts on manifold theory and Lie Groups. I include differentiable manifolds, tensors and differentiable forms. Lie groups and homogenous spaces, integration on manifolds, and in addition provide a proof of the de Rham theorem via sheaf cohomology theory, and develop the local theory of elliptic operators culminating in a proof of the Hodge theorem.  Those interested in any of the diverse areas of mathematics requiring the notion of a differentiable manifold will find me extremely useful.  </p> <p>Which Springer GTM would <i>you</i> be?  <a href="http://math.jhu.edu/~savitt/GTM.html">The Springer GTM Test</a></p></td></tr></table></p>
